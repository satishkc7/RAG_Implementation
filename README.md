# Research Paper Analysis with LLM and Vector Embeddings

  This repository provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing research papers using large language models (LLMs) and vector embeddings. The script included in this repository allows users to load and process research papers in PDF format from a specified directory. It splits these documents into manageable chunks for easier processing and embeds them into a vector store using various embedding models, including OpenAI and Ollama embeddings. Additionally, FAISS is utilized for efficient vector storage and similarity search. Once the documents are processed and embedded, the script leverages a chat-based LLM to generate insightful responses based on the integrated content of the papers. The implementation includes chain processes for document retrieval and response generation, ensuring users can query the embedded documents and obtain precise answers.
